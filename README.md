<p><h2><b>GÃ¶nninger B&T's DDS Clojure Wrapper Library for RTI Connext DDS</b></h2>

## NOTE:  June 3, 2017 - This contains pre-release X.01.00 of DDS-CLJ.

## What Is This?
DDS-CLJ is a wrapper around the RTI Connext DDS Java API. This library provides a thin layer of functions to ensure safe usage of the RTI Connext DDS Java API. It exposes the functionality as Clojure functions.

It provides (not a complete list):

* Assertions to check for valid parameters in function calls to ensure safe calls to the underlying Java API
* Debug and logging facilities to handle DDS issues

and much more - you are invited to explore ...

* A paste of the build log or failure point that you reached.
* Patience.
