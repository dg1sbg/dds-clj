<p><h2><b>GÃ¶nninger B&T's DDS Clojure Wrapper Library for RTI Connext DDS</b></h2>

## NOTE:  June 3, 2017 - This contains pre-release X.01.00 of Cellar version A.01.00.

## What Is This?
DDS-CLJ is a wrapper around the RTI Connext DDS Java API. This library provides a thin layer of functions to ensure safe usage of the RTI Connext DDS Java API. It exposes the functionality as Clojure functions.

It provides (not a complete list):

* Assertions to check for valid parameters in function calls to ensure safe calls to the underlying Java API
*
* Most of the functions described in the book On Lisp by Paul Graham
* An implementation of Finite State Machines

and much more ðŸ˜‰ - you are invited to explore ...

## Latest Release
The upcoming release is [TRIANGULUM - CELLAR X.01.00](https://github.com/dg1sbg/cellar/releases/tag/CELLAR_PREREL_X0100). See the [changes](https://github.com/dg1sbg/cellar/milestone/1) for this release.

## Reporting Problems
Generally you can report problems in two fashions, either by [opening an issue ticket](https://github.com/dg1sbg/cellar/issues/new) or by [emailing to CELLAR support](mailto:cellar-support@goenninger.net). In both cases, though, you should have the following pieces handy in order for us to be able to help you out as quickly and painlessly as possible:

* Your operating system name and version.
* The branch of DDS-CLJ that you're using.
* A paste of the build log or failure point that you reached.
* Patience.
